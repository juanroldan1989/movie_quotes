Ruby client for [MovieQuotes](https://movie-quotes-app.herokuapp.com) API

## Features

* Fetch well known quotes from more than 500 movies.
* Search through movie quotes by `actors`, `characters`, `movies`, `genres`, `years` and even pieces of quotes. 
* Intuitive API interface navigation.
* URL generation process fully tested when applying filters for each request.
* API integration tests recorded and fully tested using [VCR](https://github.com/vcr/vcr) gem: fast tests (first HTTP request is real and it's response is stored for future runs), deterministic (tests will continue to pass, even if you are offline, or API goes down for maintenance) and accurate (responses will contain the same headers and body you get from a real request).

## Installation

Install the gem by running:

```ruby
gem install movie_quotes
```

or put it in your Gemfile and run `bundle install`:

```ruby
gem "movie_quotes", "~> 0.1.3"
```

## 1. Usage

To start using the gem, you should get an API Key (free).

Once completed this quick [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeavfLgmnF2haKsaNlp8hYA4DSqdwb1ZMg5Xse7a-mFW4bZIg/viewform) the API Key will be sent to you by Juan Roldan (`juanroldan1989@gmail.com`)

Setup the API Key within an initializer:

```ruby
# movie_quotes_initializer.rb

MovieQuotes.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = "abcd1234"
end
```

Then create a new filter instance like so:

```ruby
filter = MovieQuotes.new
```

and then call api methods, for instance, to fetch well known movie quotes from `actors` like `Al Pacino`:

```ruby
filter.by_actor("al pacino")
```

or `charachters` like `morpheus`:

```ruby
filter.by_character("morpheus")
```

or `movies` like `Die Hard` and `actors` like `Bruce Willis`:

```ruby
filter.by_movie("die hard").by_actor("bruce willis")
```

Once applied all the filters you need, make the API call to get the quotes:

```ruby
filter.results
```

To see a full list of examples please check the <a href="https://github.com/juanroldan1989/movie_quotes/wiki">wiki</a> page.

## 2. Response
The response format is JSON by default. Results are provided as an array of objects with the following structure:

<div align="left">
  <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YfpDSNNgYhI/hqdefault.jpg" alt="movie_quotes die hard" />
</div>

```ruby
filter = MovieQuotes.new
filter.by_movie("die hard").by_actor("bruce willis")
filter.results
=> [

    "content": "Yippie-ki-yay, motherfucker!",
    "rating": 5,
